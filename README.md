Greetings!

This is the repository for my Capstone Project 2 for the Springboard Data Science Career Track.  The project/report/deck is entitled "Whoâ€™s a good dog? 

An exploration and assessment of using Convolutional Neural Networks to classify dog breeds from images".

In this repository, you will find the following folders and files:


1. Main Repo

3. [Jupyter Notebooks:](https://github.com/thegarrickchu/Springboard-Dog_Breed_Classifier/tree/master/notebooks)
 
    1. [Directory Setup:](https://github.com/thegarrickchu/Springboard-Dog_Breed_Classifier/blob/master/notebooks/Directory_setup.ipynb)Verify compressed dataset files, create train test directories and crop images according to annotation. Pickling and packaging images into single Nunpy array.  
  
    2. [dog_breed_EDA:](https://github.com/thegarrickchu/Springboard-Dog_Breed_Classifier/blob/master/notebooks/dog_breed_EDA.ipynb) Exploring a small selection of images, validating data, sizing up the dataset.
  
    3. [First iteration of building CNN from scratch (simple_CNN.ipynb):](https://github.com/thegarrickchu/Springboard-Dog_Breed_Classifier/blob/master/notebooks/simple_CNN.ipynb) Initial iterations of CNN models from scratch (before Directory Set up was performed).
  
    4. [CNN from Scratch using Pre-processed image data (simple_CNN_preprocessed_images.ipynb):](https://github.com/thegarrickchu/Springboard-Dog_Breed_Classifier/blob/master/notebooks/simple_CNN_preprocessed_images.ipynb) Final iteration of CNN models from Scratch which became the baseline reference for pre-trained models. 
    
    5. [Using Transfer Learning (vgg_model.ipynb):](https://github.com/thegarrickchu/Springboard-Dog_Breed_Classifier/blob/master/notebooks/vgg_model.ipynb) Using VGG16 model architecture and pre-trained weights.  Includes visualizations and predictions on test and real-world data. 
  
    5. [Deprecated:(simple_CNN_smaller_class_subset.ipynb)](https://github.com/thegarrickchu/Springboard-Dog_Breed_Classifier/blob/master/notebooks/simple_CNN_smaller_class_subset.ipynb) Tried using CNN from scratch using flow_from_directory on smaller subset of data.
